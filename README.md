# cloudsurf-extension

This is a semi-abandoned project from 2021!

Vision: We plan to release this extension in combination with a web platform to allow users to:
          1. Mark pages on the internet with "reacts", and be able to access their own reacted pages easily and intuitively.
          2. Augment the google search page with the aggregated reactions of
          cloudsurf users, allowing for people to intuitively trust or distrust sites.
          2. Be able to see the net product of everyone's data - that is, access the "most angry" or "most joyful" pages, based on aggregated tags.
          3. Be recommended new pages based on previous reaction history.
